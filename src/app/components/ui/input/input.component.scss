/* You can add component-specific styles here if needed */

/*
  Note: Most of the base styles from the React component are applied
  via the @HostBinding in the component's TypeScript file,
  mimicking the Tailwind CSS classes. If you are using Tailwind
  in your Angular project, these base styles in the SCSS file might
  not be necessary, and you would rely on Tailwind's utility classes
  applied via @HostBinding.
*/

/* Example: If you wanted to add a specific hover effect not covered by Tailwind */
/*
:host input:hover {
  border-color: blue;
}
*/
